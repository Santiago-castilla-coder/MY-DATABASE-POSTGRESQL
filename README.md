# 📚 Library Management System

This is a monolithic system for managing a library, allowing you to manage users, books, and loans.
The backend is developed with Node.js and Express, the database is managed with PostgreSQL, and the frontend is located in the app folder.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **csv-parser** (for loading data from CSV files)
- **Vite** (for rapid frontend development)

## ⚙️ Installation and Configuration

### 📌 Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (recommended version: 16+)
- **PostgreSQL** installed and running

### 📥 Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santiago-castilla-coder/MY-DATABASE-POSTGRESQL.git
cd library
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=santiago
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=db_name
DB_PORT=5432
```

4. **Start backend**

## 📌 Usage

- Access the application in the browser at the URL generated by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
- The **backend** exposes REST APIs to manage customers, invoices, transactions, and more.
- The **frontend** consumes these APIs to display and modify data.
